# Sloped Dipole Calibration (Homebrew)

This guide outlines a cheap, homebrew method to calibrate or verify a Sloped Dipole without any pre-calibrated equipment. It relies on known physics (wavelength, impedance, resonance) and public references (WWV, GPS, broadcast carriers).

## What you will build
- A simple reference or fixture based on known dimensions or components.
- A repeatable setup for measurements and comparisons.
