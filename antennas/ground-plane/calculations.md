# Calculations

## Wavelength relationships
- Wavelength (meters) = 300 / Frequency (MHz)
- Quarter-wave length = Wavelength / 4
- Half-wave length = Wavelength / 2

## Impedance
- V = I * R
- Power (W) = V^2 / R

## Example
If target frequency is 7.1 MHz:
- Wavelength = 300 / 7.1 = 42.25 m
- Half-wave = 21.1 m
