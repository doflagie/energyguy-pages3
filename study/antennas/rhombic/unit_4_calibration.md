# Unit 4 — Calibration and Tuning
**[TM-ANT-005 — Open Handout](../../antennas/rhombic/tm.html)**
**TM Chapters:** Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Appendix A
**ELOs:** Calibrate the RHOMBIC CALIBRATION (HOMEBREW) to resonance; tune SWR to within acceptance criteria; apply frequency calculations
**Estimated time:** 45 minutes (actual lab work required)

## Step 1: Read the TM

Open TM-ANT-005. Read **Chapter 5 — Calibration Procedure**, **Chapter 6 — Tuning and Adjustment**, and **Appendix A** completely.

Then come back here.

## Chapter 5 — Calibration Procedure

1. Use a stable reference signal (WWV, beacon, or known local carrier).
2. Measure resonance, SWR, or gain pattern.
3. Compare against expected values from calculations.
4. Apply corrections or document offsets.

---

## Chapter 6 — Tuning and Adjustment

1. Sweep across the target band.
2. Shorten or lengthen elements in small steps.
3. Record resonance shift per adjustment.
4. Lock the final configuration.

## Calibration vs. Tuning — Distinction

**Calibration** (Chapter 5): initial setup measurements to establish current antenna state — resonant frequency, SWR at design frequency, impedance at feedpoint. No adjustments yet; you are characterizing what you built.

**Tuning** (Chapter 6): active adjustments based on calibration data. Trim the element, adjust the matching network, or change height/orientation until Chapter 7 acceptance criteria are met.

## Acceptance Criterion

Locate the SWR or resonance acceptance criterion in Chapter 5.

Write the exact criterion from the TM here before you start:

|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Resonant frequency (MHz) | | (design freq ± tolerance) | |
| SWR at design frequency | | (from Ch. 5) | |
| Feedpoint impedance (Ω) | | (from Ch. 2) | |

## Practice Problems

**P4-1.** The design frequency of the RHOMBIC CALIBRATION (HOMEBREW) is stated in Chapter 1. Using the formula from Appendix A,
compute the theoretical element length for that frequency. Show all work.

**P4-2.** Your NanoVNA shows minimum SWR at a frequency 3% above the design frequency.
Which direction do you adjust — lengthen or shorten? By what percentage?

**P4-3.** SWR at resonance is 1.8:1, but the acceptance criterion is SWR ≤ 2.0:1.
Does the antenna pass? What does SWR 1.8:1 mean in terms of reflected power?

**P4-4.** Compute reflected power percentage for SWR = 2.0:1.
Formula: reflected power (%) = ((SWR − 1)/(SWR + 1))² × 100

## Answer Key — Practice Problems

**P4-1.** See Appendix A. For a dipole: L(ft) = 468/f(MHz). For a quarter-wave vertical: L(ft) = 234/f(MHz). Apply the formula specific to this antenna type.

**P4-2.** Resonance is above design frequency → antenna is electrically short → **lengthen** the element. Adjustment magnitude: approx. 3% longer.

**P4-3.** SWR 1.8:1 passes the 2.0:1 criterion. Reflected power: ((1.8−1)/(1.8+1))² × 100 = (0.8/2.8)² × 100 = 8.2% reflected.

**P4-4.** SWR 2.0:1: ((2−1)/(2+1))² × 100 = (1/3)² × 100 = 11.1% reflected. Most of the power still gets through.
