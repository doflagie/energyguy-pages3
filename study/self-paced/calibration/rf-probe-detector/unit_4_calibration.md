## Chapter 5 — Calibration Procedure

Step-by-Step
                
1. **Warm up** the analyzer for 10-15 minutes.
2. **Frequency check** using WWV/CHU or FM station:
3. Measure known carrier.
4. Calculate ppm error.
5. Apply correction if supported.
6. **Impedance check** using the 50 ohm load:
7. Confirm 45-55 ohm range.
8. Record SWR.
9. **Reactive check** using the shorted stub:
10. Find resonance dip.
11. Compare with calculated frequency.
12. **Document** the offsets and repeatability.

## The Calibration Procedure

Chapter 5 specifies 12 calibration steps.

Calibration is a comparison: you apply a known reference value to the instrument under test and record what the instrument reads. The difference is the error. You then either:
- Adjust the instrument until the error is within the acceptance criterion, or
- Record the error as a correction factor to apply to future readings

Locate the acceptance criterion in Chapter 5 or Chapter 7.

## Practice Problems

Work these before checking answers.

**P4-1.** The reference value is 10.000 V. Your instrument reads 10.043 V.
(a) What is the error in volts?
(b) What is the error as a percentage of the reference value? Show your work.

**P4-2.** Using the formula for % error: error% = (measured − reference) / reference × 100
Apply it to: reference = 100.0 kHz, measured = 99,985 Hz.
(a) Error in Hz.
(b) Error in %.
(c) Error in ppm.

**P4-3.** The acceptance criterion in the TM is ±1%. Your measurement gives an error of +0.8%. Does it pass? State your reasoning.

## Practice Problem Answers

**P4-1.**
(a) 10.043 − 10.000 = **+0.043 V**
(b) 0.043 / 10.000 × 100 = **+0.43%**

**P4-2.**
(a) 99,985 − 100,000 = **−15 Hz**
(b) −15 / 100,000 × 100 = **−0.015%**
(c) −15 / 100,000 × 1,000,000 = **−150 ppm**

**P4-3.** +0.8% is within ±1%. **PASS.** State: "error = +0.8%; criterion = ±1%; result = PASS." Always cite the TM section for the criterion.

## Self-Check Questions

**SC4-1.** How many steps does Chapter 5 specify for the calibration procedure?

**SC4-2.** What reference value(s) does Chapter 5 apply to the instrument under test?

**SC4-3.** State the calibration acceptance criterion from the TM. Cite the section.

**SC4-4.** Write the error formula from Appendix A. Include units.

**SC4-5.** If the instrument reads 2.3% high, is the error positive or negative? What does a positive error indicate?

---

## Answer Key

**SC4-1.** Count the numbered steps in Chapter 5. *(TM Ch. 5)*

**SC4-2.** See Chapter 5 for the reference values applied. These are the known-good inputs used to check the instrument. *(TM §5-1)*

**SC4-3.** See TM Chapter 5 or Chapter 7. Copy the criterion exactly with units and section number.

**SC4-4.** See Appendix A. Write it exactly as shown.

**SC4-5.** Positive (instrument reads higher than reference). A positive error means the instrument over-reads — it reports a value higher than the true value. *(TM App. A)*

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding, you must be able to:
- State the calibration acceptance criterion without looking
- Write the error formula from memory
- Work a % error and ppm calculation correctly
