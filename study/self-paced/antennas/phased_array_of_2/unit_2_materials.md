## Chapter 3 Content

### 3-1. BILL OF MATERIALS

| Qty | Item | Specification |
|---|---|---|
| Per NEC model | Conductor elements | Dimensions from NEC2 wire list; use copper or aluminum per design frequency |
| 1 | Feed connector | SO-239 or N-type; 50 Ω (phasing harness output) system |
| 1 | Support hardware | UV-stable; sized for operating environment (wind, ice load) |
| As needed | Feed line | RG-213 or LMR-400; match to feed impedance 50 Ω (phasing harness output) |

### 3-2. CRITICAL DIMENSIONS

```
Primary dimension formula (wavelengths)
λ (m) = 300 / fMHz
```

```
Design-specific parameters
0.5λ spacing between elements; phasing harness from matched coax lengths; ~3–4 dBi gain, cardioid pattern
```

All critical dimensions are embedded in the NEC2 model wire card (GW) definitions. Extract from phased_array_of_2.nec for precise construction reference.

## Material Selection

Review the full materials list in Chapter 3.

Before building, verify every item on the materials list. Key considerations:
- Wire gauge affects conductor resistance and therefore efficiency — use the specified gauge or heavier
- Coax type affects velocity factor, which changes electrical length vs. physical length
- Ferrite core type (#43, #61, #67) is frequency-specific for matching transformers and chokes
- Connector types affect impedance continuity — SO-239, N, BNC, and SMA each have frequency limits
- Insulator material and placement affect wind loading and UV degradation

The materials list in Chapter 3 is the bill of materials for a tested, working antenna. Substitutions must be evaluated, not assumed equivalent.

## Self-Check Questions

**SC2-1.** List the three most critical materials or components specified in Chapter 3. Why are they critical?

**SC2-2.** What wire gauge does Chapter 3 specify? What is the consequence of using a smaller gauge?

**SC2-3.** If Chapter 3 specifies coaxial cable, what type is called for? What is its velocity factor?

**SC2-4.** Does Chapter 3 specify a particular ferrite or core type? What is its application in this antenna?

**SC2-5.** What is the consequence of using a connector type outside its rated frequency range?

---

## Answer Key

**SC2-1.** See Chapter 3. Identify items with specific part numbers, gauge specifications, or where substitution would change resonant frequency or impedance.

**SC2-2.** See Chapter 3. Smaller gauge = higher conductor resistance = lower efficiency and greater I²R losses.

**SC2-3.** See Chapter 3. Common types: RG-58 (0.66 VF), RG-8X (0.84), LMR-400 (0.85). Velocity factor changes electrical length: physical length = λ × VF.

**SC2-4.** See Chapter 3. Type #43 ferrite is general HF (1–50 MHz); #61 for upper HF/VHF; #67 for VHF. Wrong material means wrong impedance ratio at the operating frequency.

**SC2-5.** A connector used beyond its frequency rating introduces unpredictable impedance discontinuities, increasing reflected power and SWR.
