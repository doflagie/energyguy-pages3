## Chapter 3 Content

| Design | Implementation | PCB trace width (50Ω FR4) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Branch-line hybrid | PCB microstrip or lumped LC at HF | 2.9mm (50Ω); 5.0mm (35.35Ω) | Best for VHF/UHF |
| Wilkinson 2-way | PCB microstrip, 2× λ/4 arms | 1.7mm (70.7Ω) | 100Ω isolation R between ports |
| Wilkinson 4-way | Two cascaded Wilkinson stages | Same | 3 dB + 3 dB = 6 dB split |
| Rat-race | PCB ring, 70.7Ω trace | 1.7mm | 3λ/2 ring circumference |

## Component Selection

Review the equipment and materials list in Chapter 3 carefully.

Before building, verify every item on the materials list. Key considerations:
- Use the specified component types — substitutions may affect performance or frequency coverage
- Non-inductive components are required in RF circuits; standard wirewound resistors are unsuitable
- Toroids and ferrite cores are frequency-specific; use the specified core material (#43, #61, #67, etc.)
- Connector types affect impedance — match the specified connector to avoid SWR errors
- Wire gauge and insulation type affect current capacity and voltage breakdown

The quality of your materials sets the ceiling on the component's performance.

## Self-Check Questions

**SC2-1.** List the three most critical components or materials specified in Chapter 3. Why are they critical?

**SC2-2.** Does Chapter 3 specify non-inductive resistors? If so, where are they used and why does it matter?

**SC2-3.** What connector type(s) does Chapter 3 specify, and what is the frequency/power justification?

**SC2-4.** Does Chapter 3 specify a particular ferrite core material or type? What is its significance?

**SC2-5.** What would be the consequence of substituting a standard wirewound resistor for a non-inductive type in an RF application?

## Answer Key

**SC2-1.** See Chapter 3. Identify items with specific part numbers, special materials, or critical tolerances — these are the ones that most affect performance.

**SC2-2.** See Chapter 3. Non-inductive types are used wherever standard inductive wirewound resistors would add series inductance that degrades high-frequency performance.

**SC2-3.** See Chapter 3. SO-239, N-type, BNC, and SMA each have different frequency and power ratings.

**SC2-4.** See Chapter 3. Ferrite #43 is for 1–100 MHz; #61 for 10–200 MHz; #67 for 50–500 MHz. Wrong material = wrong permeability = wrong coupling or suppression.

**SC2-5.** A wirewound resistor has several microhenries of series inductance. At HF and VHF, this adds inductive reactance proportional to frequency, destroying the resistor's value as a termination or load.
