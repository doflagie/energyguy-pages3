# multimeter DMM Calibration (Homebrew)

This guide shows a cheap, homebrew way to calibrate a multimeter DMM without any pre-calibrated equipment. It relies on public references (WWV, GPS, AC mains, broadcast carriers) and basic physics.

## What you will build
- One or more simple reference sources (frequency, amplitude, impedance, or level).
- A repeatable procedure to compare your instrument to the reference.

## Required references
- WWV/WWVH time signals (frequency reference)
- GPS 1PPS (timing reference)
- AC mains (low-frequency reference)
- Simple known components (resistors, capacitors, inductors)
