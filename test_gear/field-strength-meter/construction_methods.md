# Construction Methods

Build simple fixtures from inexpensive parts.

## Example fixtures
- Frequency reference: GPS module 1PPS and a small divider or counter.
- Amplitude reference: precision resistor divider and a stable supply.
- Impedance reference: known resistors/capacitors or a simple bridge.

## Notes
- Use short leads and good grounding.
- Shield sensitive circuits when possible.
