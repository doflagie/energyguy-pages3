# Calculations

Use these formulas to compute expected values and compare them to measured values.

## Frequency reference
- Error (ppm) = ((measured - expected) / expected) * 1,000,000

## Voltage and current references
- V = I * R
- I = V / R

## Reactance for capacitors and inductors
- Xc = 1 / (2 * pi * f * C)
- Xl = 2 * pi * f * L

## Example
If a 10 MHz reference is measured as 9,999,800 Hz:
- Error = (9,999,800 - 10,000,000) / 10,000,000
- Error = -20 ppm
