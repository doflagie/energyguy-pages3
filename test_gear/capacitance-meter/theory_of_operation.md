# Theory of Operation

The capacitance meter measures a physical property (frequency, amplitude, impedance, or modulation). Calibration is a comparison between the instrument reading and a reference derived from physics or known component values. The key is repeatability: a stable source and a stable measurement setup.

## Core idea
- Convert the measurement into a known value using a reference.
- Quantify the error as a ratio or offset.
- Apply correction or record a correction table.
