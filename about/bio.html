                <h1>About Mervyn Martin</h1>

                <p>I'm a Navy veteran, electronics enthusiast, and aspiring amateur radio operator currently based in Merced, California. This site documents my journey through electronics, radio, and engineering projects as I continue to rebuild after the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise.</p>

                <h2>Military Service</h2>

                <p><strong>U.S. Navy (1983-2004) - Cryptologic Technician - Maintenance (CTM)</strong></p>

                <p>I served 21 years in the Navy specializing in SIGINT (signals intelligence) operations. My duties included:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Radio Direction Finding:</strong> HF/VHF/UHF signal analysis and geolocation</li>
                    <li><strong>Communications Intelligence:</strong> Signal collection and technical analysis</li>
                    <li><strong>Darkroom Operations:</strong> Film photography and photographic intelligence processing</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Operations:</strong> Equipment maintenance, calibration, and troubleshooting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This Navy experience gave me a solid foundation in RF theory, antenna systems, signal analysis, and the importance of proper grounding and shielding. Many of my current projects draw on lessons learned during those years at sea.</p>

                <h2>The Camp Fire (2018)</h2>

                <p>On November 8, 2018, the Camp Fire destroyed Merced, California. Like 95% of my neighbors, I lost everything. The fire killed 85 people and burned 153,336 acres in a matter of hours. It was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.</p>

                <p>I evacuated with minutes to spare. Everything I owned—tools, equipment, books, electronics, a lifetime of accumulated knowledge—was gone. Starting over has been a long process, but it's also been an opportunity to rebuild more thoughtfully, with better designs and documented processes.</p>

                <h2>Stroke and Recovery (2015)</h2>

                <p>In 2015, I suffered a stroke that affected my right side. Recovery has been ongoing. I can do most things I used to do, though some tasks require adapted techniques or tools.</p>

                <p class="highlight">"Can't do as much as I used to though. Yet."</p>

                <p>That "yet" is important. Many of my designs include adaptations for one-handed operation or reduced mobility. If these help someone else facing similar challenges, that makes the work doubly worthwhile.</p>

                <h2>Current Projects and Goals</h2>

                <h3>Amateur Radio (2026 Goal: Technician License)</h3>

                <p>I'm studying for my Technician license exam, scheduled for May-June 2026. My station plans include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>27' Telescoping Mast:</strong> Tilt-down design for EFHW and vertical antennas</li>
                    <li><strong>QRP Operations:</strong> (tr)uSDX transceiver for CW and digital modes</li>
                    <li><strong>POTA Activations:</strong> Portable station for Parks on the Air</li>
                    <li><strong>Station Grounding:</strong> Star ground configuration with lightning protection</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SDR Cluster Project</h3>

                <p>I'm building a Raspberry Pi and Rock64 cluster for software-defined radio applications. The cluster uses:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Corosync/Pacemaker for cluster management</li>
                    <li><strong>RFI Mitigation:</strong> Custom Faraday cages for SBC nodes</li>
                    <li><strong>Distributed Processing:</strong> Multiple RTL-SDR and HackRF devices</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Prometheus and Grafana for cluster health</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3D Design and Print-on-Demand</h3>

                <p>I'm developing OpenSCAD designs for print-on-demand sales through Shapeways and similar services:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neveready Battery Case:</strong> USB-C power bank for 4× 18650 cells</li>
                    <li><strong>Darkroom Safelight:</strong> Red LED safelight based on Navy darkroom designs</li>
                    <li><strong>Ferro Rod Handle:</strong> Large-grip fire starter for one-handed operation</li>
                    <li><strong>Amateur Radio Accessories:</strong> Various station accessories and tools</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Telegraph Restoration and Documentation</h3>

                <p>I collect and restore vintage telegraph equipment, particularly Vibroplex semi-automatic keys. I'm also documenting wireless telegraph systems and loop current networks for educational purposes.</p>

                <h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>

                <p>I'm a strong believer in self-education through books, experimentation, and documentation. Current learning focuses include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Filter Design:</strong> "The Art of Electronics" by Horowitz & Hill</li>
                    <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> "No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra" by Savov</li>
                    <li><strong>Antenna Theory:</strong> ARRL Antenna Book, practical modeling with 4NEC2</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signal Processing:</strong> Experimenting with GNU Radio and SDR</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I document everything I learn, not just for my own reference, but to help others avoid the mistakes I've made and build on the successes.</p>

                <h2>Why "EnergyGuy"?</h2>

                <p>The name comes from my Navy days—I was always the guy who could find the signal, isolate the noise, and explain the RF environment. Energy (in the electromagnetic sense) was my domain.</p>

                <p>Now it represents a broader mission: preserving and sharing technical knowledge about radio, electronics, and practical engineering.</p>

                <h2>Knowledge Preservation</h2>

                <p>I won't be around forever. None of us will. But the knowledge and techniques we document can outlive us. That's why I'm putting everything online—detailed documentation, measured results, failures as well as successes.</p>

                <p>If something here helps someone understand a filter better, build a more reliable antenna, or solve a problem I've already tackled, then this work has lasting value.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>A Note on Accessibility:</strong> Many designs on this site include adaptations for one-handed operation or reduced mobility. These aren't "special needs" designs—they're just good design that happens to work for more people. If you have suggestions for improvements, I'm always interested in learning.</p>
