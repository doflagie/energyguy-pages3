## Overview

### The Problem

You have a **BM4070 digital lcr tester** that needs calibration, but:
- ❌ No access to calibrated reference equipment
- ❌ No calibration lab available
- ❌ Commercial calibration costs $100-500+
- ❌ Downtime waiting for calibration service

### The Solution

**Bootstrap calibration** using fundamental physical constants and freely available reference signals.

**What we'll use:**
- 📡 **WWV/WWVH** - NIST time signal stations (2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 MHz)
- 🛰️ **GPS 1PPS** - GPS satellite timing pulses (±40 nanosecond accuracy)
- ⚡ **AC Mains** - Power line frequency (60 Hz, ±0.02 Hz in North America)
- 🔬 **Precision resistors** - 0.1% tolerance for voltage/current standards
- 📐 **Physics calculations** - Known resonant frequencies, speed of light

**Result:** ±1-2% accuracy - excellent for amateur radio and electronics work!

## Philosophy: Bootstrap Calibration

### How Do You Calibrate Without Calibrated Equipment?

This is the classic "chicken and egg" problem of metrology. The answer: **use fundamental physical constants**.

**The Hierarchy of Standards:**

```
Level 0: Fundamental Physical Constants
         ├─ Speed of light (c = 299,792,458 m/s exactly)
         ├─ Planck constant (h = 6.62607015×10⁻³⁴ J⋅s)
         └─ Elementary charge (e = 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ C)

Level 1: Primary Standards (National Labs)
         ├─ Cesium atomic clock (defines the second)
         ├─ Josephson junction (voltage standard)
         └─ Quantum Hall effect (resistance standard)

Level 2: Secondary Standards (Calibration Labs)
         ├─ GPS-disciplined oscillators
         ├─ Transfer standards
         └─ Working standards

Level 3: Working References (Our Level!)
         ├─ WWV/WWVH radio signals
         ├─ GPS timing receivers
         ├─ Precision resistors (traceable)
         └─ AC mains frequency (grid-averaged)

Level 4: Your Equipment
         └─ BM4070 digital lcr tester ← We're here!
```

**We operate at Level 3**, using freely available references derived from Level 1 and Level 2 standards.

### Why This Works

1. **WWV accuracy**: Better than 1×10⁻¹² (1 part in trillion)
2. **GPS timing**: ±40 nanoseconds (0.00000004 seconds)
3. **AC mains**: Long-term averaged to atomic clock (power grid regulation)
4. **Precision resistors**: Manufactured to 0.1%, traceable to NIST

**Bottom line:** Our bootstrap calibration is often MORE accurate than factory calibration on consumer test equipment!

## Theory of Operation

### What We're Calibrating

An LCR meter measures:
1. **Inductance (L)** - Henries (H, mH, µH)
2. **Capacitance (C)** - Farads (F, µF, nF, pF)
3. **Resistance (R)** - Ohms (Ω, kΩ, MΩ)
4. **Derived parameters** - Q factor, D (dissipation), ESR

### Critical Parameters

**Capacitance Calibration:**
- Uses known capacitors (1%, 5% tolerance)
- Verify with calculated LC resonance
- Cross-check with RC time constant

**Inductance Calibration:**
- Uses calculated inductors (toroid cores)
- Verify with LC resonance
- Difficult to get precision standards

**Resistance Calibration:**
- Uses precision resistors (same as multimeter calibration)
- Simpler than L or C

### Bootstrap Method: LC Resonance

**Key formula:**
```
f = 1 / (2π√(LC))

Rearranging:
C = 1 / (4π² × f² × L)
L = 1 / (4π² × f² × C)
```

**How it works:**
1. Build LC circuit with unknown inductor and known capacitor
2. Measure resonant frequency (using oscilloscope or frequency counter)
3. Calculate unknown L from known C and measured f
4. Or vice versa!

## Reference Standards

### 1. Precision Capacitors

**Polystyrene or C0G/NP0 capacitors:**
- Available tolerances: 1%, 2%, 5%
- Temperature coefficient: <30 ppm/°C
- Stable over time
- Cost: $0.50-2 each

**Recommended values:**
- 100 pF (1%, C0G)
- 1000 pF = 1 nF (1%, C0G)
- 10 nF (5%, polystyrene)
- 100 nF (5%, film)
- 1 µF (5%, film)

**Where to buy:**
- Mouser, Digi-Key (C0G/NP0 ceramic or polystyrene)
- Avoid electrolytic for precision work
- Avoid generic ceramics (X7R, Y5V - poor tolerance)

### 2. Calculated Inductors

**Toroid core inductors:**
- Wind your own on toroid core
- Calculate turns from AL value
- Verify with LC resonance

**Formula:**
```
L = AL × N²

Where:
L = Inductance in µH
AL = Inductance factor (µH per 100 turns squared)
N = Number of turns
```

**Example:**
- Core: T50-2 (red) toroid
- AL = 49 µH/100 turns²
- For 10 µH: N = √(10 / 0.49) = √20.4 = 4.5 turns → 5 turns
- Actual L = 49 × (5)² / 10000 = 49 × 25 / 10000 = 12.25 µH

**Verify with resonance:**
1. Add known 1000 pF capacitor
2. Measure resonant frequency with oscilloscope + signal generator
3. Calculate L from f and C
4. Compare to calculated value

### 3. WWV for Frequency Measurement

**Using WWV to calibrate frequency:**
- Tune to 10 MHz WWV carrier
- Use as frequency reference
- Calibrate frequency counter or oscilloscope timebase first
- Then use calibrated frequency measurement for LC resonance

## Calibration Fixture Design

### LC Resonance Test Fixture

**Purpose:** Measure resonant frequency to calculate L or C

**Circuit:**
```
Function Generator ────┬─── L (unknown inductor)
(Sweep 100 kHz-10 MHz) │
                       ├─── C (known capacitor)
                       │
                       ├─── 100Ω resistor (to ground)
                       │
                      GND

Oscilloscope probe connects across 100Ω resistor
At resonance: Maximum voltage across resistor
```

**How it works:**
1. LC circuit has resonant frequency where XL = XC
2. At resonance, impedance is minimum (just resistance)
3. Maximum current flows
4. Maximum voltage drop across 100Ω sense resistor
5. Peak on oscilloscope shows resonant frequency

**Procedure:**
1. Set function generator to sweep mode (or manually sweep)
2. Observe oscilloscope for maximum amplitude
3. Measure frequency at peak
4. Calculate unknown L (if C known) or C (if L known)

## Construction Methods

### Step 1: Build Precision Capacitor Standards

1. **Select and verify capacitors:**
   - Buy 1% or 2% tolerance C0G/NP0 capacitors
   - Values: 100pF, 1nF, 10nF, 100nF, 1µF
   - Mount on small PCB with BNC connector
   - Label each with value and tolerance

2. **Cross-verify if possible:**
   - If you have two LCR meters, compare readings
   - Or use LC resonance method (if you have one known inductor)
   - Record actual measured value

### Step 2: Wind Calibrated Inductors

**Example: 10 µH inductor on T50-2 core**

1. **Calculate turns:**
   ```
   L = AL × N² / 10000
   10 µH = 49 × N² / 10000
   N² = 10 × 10000 / 49
   N² = 204
   N = 14.3 turns → Use 14 turns

   Actual L = 49 × 14² / 10000 = 49 × 196 / 10000 = 9.6 µH
   ```

2. **Wind the toroid:**
   - Cut ~50cm of 24 AWG magnet wire
   - Thread through toroid core 14 times
   - Keep turns evenly spaced
   - Scrape enamel from ends (~1cm)
   - Tin ends with solder

3. **Verify with LC resonance:**
   - Add known 1000 pF capacitor in parallel
   - Calculate expected resonance:
     ```
     f = 1 / (2π√(LC))
     f = 1 / (2π√(9.6µH × 1000pF))
     f = 1 / (2π√(9.6×10⁻⁶ × 1×10⁻⁹))
     f = 1 / (2π√(9.6×10⁻¹⁵))
     f = 1 / (2π × 3.1×10⁻⁸)
     f = 1 / (1.95×10⁻⁷)
     f = 5.13 MHz
     ```
   - Measure actual resonance with LC fixture
   - Calculate actual L from measured f
   - Label inductor with measured value

### Step 3: Build LC Resonance Test Fixture

1. **Assemble circuit on perfboard:**
   - BNC input (from function generator)
   - Sockets for test capacitor and inductor
   - 100Ω sense resistor to ground
   - BNC output (to oscilloscope) across sense resistor

2. **Mount in enclosure:**
   - Aluminum box for shielding
   - Label inputs and outputs clearly

3. **Test fixture:**
   - Connect function generator and oscilloscope
   - Insert known L and C
   - Sweep frequency, find resonant peak
   - Verify calculated frequency matches measured
