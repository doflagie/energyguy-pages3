# Oscilloscope Verification

## Verification Checklist

- Re-measure the reference carrier after calibration.
- Measure a second independent reference (FM vs WWV/CHU).
- Confirm measurements are stable across 3-5 repetitions.

## Acceptance Targets

- Frequency accuracy: within 0.1-1 ppm of reference.
- Load accuracy: within 1-2% of 50 ohm.
