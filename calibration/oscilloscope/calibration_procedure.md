# Oscilloscope Calibration Procedure

## Step-by-Step

1. **Warm up** the analyzer for 10-15 minutes.
2. **Frequency check** using WWV/CHU or FM station:
   - Measure known carrier.
   - Calculate ppm error.
   - Apply correction if supported.
3. **Impedance check** using the 50 ohm load:
   - Confirm 45-55 ohm range.
   - Record SWR.
4. **Reactive check** using the shorted stub:
   - Find resonance dip.
   - Compare with calculated frequency.
5. **Document** the offsets and repeatability.
