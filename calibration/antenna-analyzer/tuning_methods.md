# Antenna Analyzer Tuning Methods

## Frequency Axis Check

- Measure WWV/CHU or FM carrier frequency.
- Compare to published frequency.
- If your analyzer supports frequency offset adjustment, apply correction.

## Impedance/SWR Check

- Connect the 50 ohm load.
- The analyzer should read close to 50 ohm and low SWR.
- Connect the shorted stub and locate the resonance dip; compare to expected.

## Trim and Iterate

- If stub resonance is off, trim length in small increments.
- Re-check until resonance aligns within expected tolerance.
